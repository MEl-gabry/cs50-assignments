              Critical Role, our show, is a long-running web series in which our group of nerdy ass voice actors use tabletop roleplaying game mechanics as the medium to build a longform improvisational story in the vast and rich fantasy world of Exandria. 
              The players are guided through the world by Matthew Mercer, an incredibly experienced Game Master. 
              Essentially, this story is like a four-hour long improvised episode of television, with each campaign focusing on its own set of characters within the world.
          </p>

              Critical Role’s first campaign witnessed the adventures of Vox Machina, a group of mercenaries turned heroes to Exandria’s continent of Tal’Dorei. 
              This adventuring group first joined together years before the show began streaming. 
              The story picks up right in the middle of their adventures. 
              The first campaign is currently being adapted into an animated series, The Legend of Vox Machina, with our friends at Titmouse and Amazon Studios, releasing February 4, 2022.
          </p>
              The second campaign of Critical Role is set in the war-threatened continent of Wildemount, and sees a group of disparate souls form the Mighty Nein, going on to take actions that shape the fate of Wildemount and the wider Exandria.
          </p>
          <p>    
              Critical Role’s third campaign embarks October 21, 2021 on the continent of Marquet. 
              This story takes place canonically after the events of Campaign 2 and Exandria Unlimited, our mini-series set in Tal’Dorei that was run by the fabulous Game Master Aabria Iyengar. 
              If you’d like to know more about the setting of Marquet, check out our warm welcome article written by Matthew Mercer here.

              And as a friendly reminder, you don’t have to do anything to prepare yourself before watching Campaign 3. 
              This is a totally new adventure. 
              There may be some familiar characters, events, and lore referenced throughout the campaign that folks who have watched Campaign 1, Campaign 2, or Exandria Unlimited might recognize, but don’t let that deter you from diving in. 
              A lot happens in hundreds of episodes and there is no pressure to be an expert or to know everything. The good news is that the Critter community is super helpful and if there’s something you’re not familiar with, odds are someone will kindly provide you with the information you seek.
